PLG_ATOOLSJUPDATECHECK_EMAIL_IMPORTANTNOTES="----------\n*** IMPORTANT NOTES ***\nThis email is not a spam or phishing email. It is NOT sent from an external site, third party service or mailing list. It sent to all Super Administrators by a system plugin running on your own site. You explicitly activated this feature when you installed Admin Tools Professional on your site (this feature is never activated without your explicit conscent). Nobody else except you has access to any of the information contained in this email message. You will receive this email message once every day until you upgrade Joomla! to the latest release, either by clicking the link above or by any other method, e.g. going to your site's back-end, Components, Admin Tools and click on the JOOMLA! CORE UPDATE button. The link above will automatically log you in to your site and is only valid for 24 hours or until you click on it for the first time or until another Super Administrator clicks on his own URL, also sent to him/her via email, whichever comes first; it will become inactive afterwards. If you wish to DISABLE this email notification about new Joomla! releases, please go to your site's back-end, click on Extensions, Plug-in Manager, find the ''System - Joomla! Update Email'' plugin and unpublish it. Please do not contact the developers of Admin Tools regarding this email message; such requests will be ignored, as this email contains all the information you need to know.\n----------"
